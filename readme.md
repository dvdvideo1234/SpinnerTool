# SpinnerTool
Spinner tool entity
```
This script creates spinner entity and fixes the following problems
1. Genaral motor tool persiting in Gmod has tendency to rotate in the oposite way when the car is fased south-north
2. Wire motor tool has strange behaviour when the motor is duped or the spinning part recieves high angular velocities
3. Wheels do not have round shape so they bounce on high torques
